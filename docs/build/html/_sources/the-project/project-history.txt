The project history
===================

The Department of Information Engineering and Computer Science (DISI) at the University of Trento has some research teams working on sensor
networks for home nursering.

They needed a **framework** capable of easily integrate different projects developed in heterogeneous languages, make them
work together, to help testing and to produce visual demos for research partners. This way teams at DISI can focus on the core of their research,
instead of developing custom solutions for every different project.

These are the main Freedomotic goals and requirements: maintaining the framework flexible and modular so that it can be easily integrated and adapted to
different (and potentially unknown) needs.
