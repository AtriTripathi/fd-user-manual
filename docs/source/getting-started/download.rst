Docker container
----------------

TO BE COMPLETED

For those of you willing to try Freedomotic dailybuild inside a Docker environment, we just created a demo container with some simple usage instructions.
Given you have docker installed on your machine, giving it a try is as simple as running
 
.. code:: 
      
      docker run -p 9111:9111 freedomotic/freedomotic
     

RestApi interface will be available on port 9111 of host machine after a few seconds.
For tech details please go to https://hub.docker.com/r/freedomotic/freedomotic/.

On next days we'll try to test P2P feature in a docker environment with (at least) two Freedomotic instances. 
If you think there may be more interesting usage scenarios for such containers, just share!
