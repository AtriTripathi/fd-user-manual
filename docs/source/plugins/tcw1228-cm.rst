Overview
--------
TCW122B-CM is a multifunctional device for remote monitoring and control, designed to work in IP based networks. It can be managed by WEB interface, SNMP programs and user applications. The controller can be used as standalone device or as a part of control and monitoring systems.    The device utilizes special schematic for long 1-Wire interface support, up to 2 temperature or temperature/humidity sensors can be connected. Along with ambient parameters, two analog voltages and status of two digital inputs can be monitored. For every parameter can be sent e-mail and/or SNMP trap, if it goes outside of previously set-up range.
The both relays can be activated locally - from status of monitored parameters or remotely - by WEB interface, SNMP managers etc.
